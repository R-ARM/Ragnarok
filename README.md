# This is the home of Project Revolution

Ever been frustrated with most OSes for Linux friendly handhelds being just Linux with a custom DE?

Here comes the Project Revolution

## Goals:
- Lightning fast bootup, 3 seconds at most from reset vector
- Entirely custom userspace, tailored for handheld gaming
- Transparent handling of emulation ROMs, through retroarch
- Be as usable as it is possible. Battle PSP for its usability
